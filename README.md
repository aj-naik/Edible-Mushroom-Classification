# Edible-Mushroom-Classification
Edible or Not? This is a ML web app for classifying if mushrooms are edible or not

# Demo
![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51918054/120270727-b1ab3500-c2c7-11eb-9d7b-56fcdc0d54d7.gif)

# Running it Locally:
- Clone the repo
- Run 'pip install streamlit' also install other dependencies like PyDeck, Plotly Express
- Open a Command Prompt in project directory and run 'streamlit run app.py'

# Dataset
This [data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom) includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one.

# Data Preprocessing
Converted categorical labels into numerical using label encoder.

# Project History
My third Streamlit app and first ML Webapp. Made this app in September 2020 while learning about Data and ML deployment and since then have been using Streamlit as webapps using it are easy to build.
Learnt about streamlit from Snehan Kekre for anyone interested.
